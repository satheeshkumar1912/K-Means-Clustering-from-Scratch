# *K-Means-Clustering-from-Scratch*
Implementing and Analyzing K-Means Clustering from Scratch

# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their demographic
and spending behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to
identify distinct customer groups that can help businesses make better
data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
A synthetic dataset containing 200 customer records was used in this project.
The dataset includes the following features:

- Age
- Annual Income
- Years of Experience
- Spending Score

An additional column indicating purchase behavior is used only for interpretation
and not for clustering.

## Approach
1. Load and understand the dataset
2. Select relevant features for clustering
3. Visualize and explore data patterns
4. Choose the number of clusters (K = 4)
5. Initialize centroids
6. Assign data points to nearest centroids
7. Update centroids using mean values
8. Repeat until convergence
9. Interpret and evaluate clusters

## Algorithm Used
- K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Machine Learning)

## Results
The algorithm successfully grouped customers into four meaningful clusters.
Each cluster represents a different customer segment based on income,
experience, and spending behavior.

## Business Insights
- Different marketing strategies can be designed for each customer group
- High spending clusters can be targeted with premium offers
- Low engagement clusters can be nurtured with promotions

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how K-Means clustering can be used to discover
hidden patterns in customer data and support business decision-making.


    This is designed reality, not randomness.
